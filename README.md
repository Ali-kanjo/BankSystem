### README.md for the Full Project (with Transactions)

# Complete C++ Bank Management System

This project is a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) application for a bank management system, built with C++. It provides integrated functionalities for both client account management (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and essential financial transactions like deposits and withdrawals.

## üåü Features

-   **Full Client Management**:
    -   List all registered clients in a formatted table.
    -   Add a new client with unique account number validation.
    -   Update an existing client's information.
    -   Delete a client's account from the system after confirmation.
    -   Find a specific client by their account number.
-   **Transactions Menu**:
    -   **Deposit**: Add funds to a client's account balance.
    -   **Withdraw**: Deduct funds from a client's balance, with validation to prevent overdrawing.
    -   **Total Balances**: Calculate and display the sum of all client balances held by the bank.
-   **Interactive UI**: Nested menus provide a clear and easy-to-use interface for navigating between client management and financial transactions.
-   **Data Persistence**: All changes are saved to a local `Clients.txt` file, ensuring that data is not lost between sessions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application uses a `stClient` struct to organize client data, which is loaded into an in-memory `vector` on startup. All operations are first handled in memory and then written back to the `Clients.txt` file for persistence. The codebase is designed to be modular, with each major functionality separated into its own function for clarity and maintainability.

## üöÄ How to Run

To run this project, you will need a C++ compiler (e.g., G++, Clang, MSVC).

1.  Compile the code using the following command:
    ```sh
    g++ main.cpp -o bank_system
    ```
2.  After a successful compilation, run the program:
    ```sh
    ./bank_system
    ```

## üìñ How to Use

1.  From the **Main Menu**, you can perform client management operations (options 1-5).
2.  Select option ** Transactions** to access the sub-menu for deposits, withdrawals, and viewing total balances.
3.  Follow the on-screen prompts to complete any operation.
4.  Select option ** Exit** to close the program.
